            <!-- In this study you will first be shown information about the strengths and weaknesses of the AI model including its accuracy for questions covering specific categories of knowledge. Next you will complete a quiz designed to test your knowledge of the model’s strengths and weaknesses presented in the teaching phase. Finally, you will answer a series of multiple choice questions pertaining to different subjects such as social sciences, elementary math problems, politics, and more. When answering these questions, you will have the option to view the corresponding prediction and explanation from an AI model. It is up to you to decide whether to trust the AI prediction or solve the task yourself.
            Your goal is to be as accurate as possible in answering the questions. You will be compensated according to the number of tasks you complete. Please note that you will be compensated for each completed task regardless of the correctness of your answers. -->
